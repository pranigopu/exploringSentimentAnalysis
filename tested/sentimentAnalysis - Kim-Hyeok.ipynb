There were cockroaches roaming freely in the room and shower. Almost every thing needs fixing, yellowish stained bed linen, super old towels, Tv that does not work, lights that dont work, Shower fittings that are broken - almost everything needs to be fixed. In all the rooms that I stayed the stem of the ceiling fan touches the false ceiling sending out vibrations that can give you a head ache in a few minutes. I stayed in the pavilion room which is the superior one. You can imagine the condition of the standard rooms.  They seriously need to think about injecting some capital into this property. As of now stay away ! \n",

If possible take the larger club room it comes with a balcony. Just a handful of staff maintain this place and they are a nice lot. Quality of breakfast in the small restaurant was erratic. Avoid the Idly which are a disaster. The hotel is in a quiet side road in Jayanagar and there is a nice restaurant and departmental store called Simpli Namdhari about 50 yards away. The linen and bedding badly need to be replaced. I had a convenient stay. \n",

Few minutes after settling in the room realised bathroom floor was all wet and water from the drainage was all over the floor. Yuk..... We informed Reception and manger was not even bothered to come and talk to us about the issue. He sent one of the staff member who was helpless, he moped the floor and still water was coming out of the drainage... they told us to call reception every time the floor got wet so that staff can wipe all water. What a great idea The Manager gave... Imagine doing it all night... who would want to do it? Room was smelly.. Manager was not even ready to provide different room and was lying all rooms are booked. After yelling on the staff different room was alloted. \n",

            "Hi,  Here is another corporate review of one of the places I have stayed at during my official trips....   Good... 1. Staff is very cooperative 2. Manager is very cooperative 3. Ambience is Decent 4. Location is Prime for business travellers 5. Accessibility to major parts of the city is good 6. Major facilities are available nearby like Eateries, Medicine shops, Coffee Day etc  Bad.... 1. Food can be moved up a bit in quality 2. Staff needs to be more trained on maintenance of the location 3. Post 11 Pm the kitchen is closed so would be difficult if you have midnight hunger pangs 4. Mosquito's can be a issue if you open the window (but that is off course not a hotel fault)....  Have a good trip... and do press like if you appreciate the review. \n",

The construction is quite new and the management is maintaining it so well. They have their in house restaurant which includes variety of food and the staff of both kitchen and house keeping are so friendly. They will go out of the way for customer satisfaction.

The property was simple yet had all the amenities you can ask for in a good budget hotel except for the staff......  The staff was exceptional! From the GM Raphael Shah to the front office staff of Bikram and team - their hospitality, care and courtesy completely bowled us over! Hats off to such employees - the management are lucky to have them and it would be our pleasure to visit and enjoy this property on future ocassions. \n",

The AC had no remote and used to on and off through the MCB switch. The washroom was full of small insects. Many switches and light fittings dont work. In a double room only 1 towel was kept. It takes them a reminder to provide a 2nd one. The breakfast was extremely mediocre and even not replinished on time. The in room dining food was tasteless and chapatis were cold. Not a value for money place at all. Avoid \n",

We forced to take back our advance and he wasn't even sorry he lost the big booking.  Water is a problem in the bathroom, Linen is not clean sometimes but the tipping point is the behavior of Mr. Sanjeev.  Please do not book in this hotel. You will repent. \n",

            "Rooms we were very dirty. My grandparents stayed in this hotel twice and we did not get hot water in the morning when we wanted to shower. If i call up the reception, the lady said that she cannot do anything as she does  not know what to do. When i spoke to the manager Mr. Sanjeev, he was very very rude and he said you cannot call for every small problem. He told us if we want we can check out. Very very rude of him. He should be fired. \n",
